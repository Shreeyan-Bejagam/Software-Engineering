**Doxygen:**
Doxygen is a documentation generator tool that is used to generate documentation from annotated source code in various programming languages like C++, C, Java, Python, etc. It generates documentation in multiple formats, including HTML, LaTeX, RTF, and XML. Doxygen allows developers to document their code effectively using special comments, which are then processed to produce structured documentation, including class hierarchies, collaboration diagrams, and more.

**GitHub:**
GitHub is a web-based platform for version control using Git. It provides hosting for software development projects, enabling developers to collaborate on code, track changes, and manage version histories. GitHub offers features such as pull requests, issue tracking, branching, and merging, facilitating collaboration among team members. It also serves as a platform for sharing open-source projects and discovering code repositories created by other developers. GitHub is widely used by individuals, organizations, and businesses for software development and project management.
